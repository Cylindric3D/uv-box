Tips for Creating the PCB
=========================
For creating the PCBs with UV-sensitive boards:

1. Text on the B.Cu layer should appear mirrored
2. Plot only the bottom copper "B.Cu" layer to PDF, do not mirror it - it should look mirrored in the PDF.
   This is because you want the ink to be as close to the photo-sensitive surface of the PCB as possible.
3. Print the B_Cu.pdf onto transparencies suitable for your printer.
